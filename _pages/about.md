* I am joining Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta for an MS in Computer Science starting Fall '19!
* I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with a honors in Computer Vision advised by [Prof. Anoop Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/).
* Last summer, I interned at the ADAS group at [Computer Vision Center, UAB]() where I worked with [Prof. Antonio Lopez](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~antonio/site/) on domain adaptation of imitation learning agents in the CARLA simulator.
* My research interests are computer vision and machine learning particularly in generative models, simulation to real transfer, model compression, autonomous driving and visual navigation, domain adaptation and 3D scene understanding.
* In my free time, I like to play basketball, read, play DotA, watch anime and go trekking.
* If you would like to say hi or would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to mail me at rohitgajawada at gatech dot edu.
