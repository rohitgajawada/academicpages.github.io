* I am pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with a honors in Computer Vision advised by [Prof. Anoop Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/). I interned at the ADAS group at [Computer Vision Center, UAB]() where I worked with [Prof. Antonio Lopez](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~antonio/site/).
* My research interests are computer vision and machine learning particularly in generative models, deep representational learning, deep model compression, autonomous driving, domain adaptation and tracking.
* In my free time, I like to play basketball, read, play DotA and watch anime.
* If you would like to say hi or would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to message me at gajawadarohit at gmail dot com.
