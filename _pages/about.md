* I am a first year MS in Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics!
* I will be interning at PathAI, Boston as a Machine Learning Intern in Summer 2020! I will also be interning at Uber ATG, San Francisco in Fall 2020!
* I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with a honors in Computer Vision advised by [Prof. Anoop Namboodiri](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~anoop/).
* In Summer 2017, I interned at the ADAS group at [Computer Vision Center, UAB]() where I worked with [Prof. Antonio Lopez](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~antonio/) on domain adaptation of imitation learning agents in the CARLA simulator.
* My research interests are computer vision and machine learning particularly in machine learning with limited supervision, generative models, simulation to real transfer, model compression and autonomous driving.
* In my free time, I like to play basketball, swim, play DotA, watch anime and go trekking.
* If you would like to say hi, please feel free to mail me at rohitgajawada at gatech dot edu.
